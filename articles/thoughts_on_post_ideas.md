# Thoughts On Why I Have Not Been Able to Start a Blog 

## No good ideas

I have tried blogging a few times in the past, but I have never been able to keep with it. Every time I started blogging, I wasnt able to continue making posts, so I stopped. A common problem I experienced in each of my bloggingattempts was that, I had difficulty coming up with ideas to write about. Whenever I tried writing, my mind would go blank.

Strangely, though i have trouble blogging, I have no trouble "micro-blogging" on Twitter. In fact, I have reached over 400 posts on my twitter account. Why is it that I can micro blog, but not blog?

With twitter, I make a tweet as soon as I think of a good idea for one. By doing this I never run into writer's block becuse I only start writing when I have something to write about. I think this is a good approach for blogging as well because its not that I _don't_ have good ideas to write about, its that I can't remember them when I want to start writing.

## Going forward
